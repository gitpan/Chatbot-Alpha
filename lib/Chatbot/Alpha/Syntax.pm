=head1 NAME

Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax - Syntax checking for Chatbot::Alpha replies.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax;
  
  my $syntax = new Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax;
  
  # Set 'strict' syntax.
  $syntax->syntax ('strict');
  
  # Changed my mind, use 'loose'
  $syntax->syntax ('loose');
  
  # Only allow SOME commands.
  $syntax->deny_type ('allow_some');
  
  # Allow only +'s and -'s.
  $syntax->allow ('+', '-');
  
  # Syntax-check this file.
  $syntax->check ("replies.cba");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax provides syntax checking for Alpha documents. All syntax errors
result in a 'die' so don't expect to run your syntax checking halfway through a large
application's process. Doing it in initialization is always fine though.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new (ARGUMENTS)

Creates a new Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax object. You can pass in any defaults here.

=head2 syntax (TYPE)

Define a syntax type, either 'strict' or 'loose'. Defaults to strict. See below for definitions
on the various syntax types.

=head2 deny_type (DENYTYPE)

Must be 'deny_all', 'deny_some', 'allow_some', or 'allow_all' - defaults to 'allow_all'. If you're
going to want to deny/allow certain commands, it's best to use deny_type to set this. The automatic
settings of deny() and allow() may not always end up how you want them.

=head2 deny (COMMANDS)

Denies a list of COMMANDS. These are the Alpha commands (+, -, @, &, etc). Syntax errors will
arrise when these commands are found in the Alpha document.

=head2 allow (COMMANDS)

Adds COMMANDS to the allow list.

=head2 check (FILE)

Check the syntax of FILE. Will return 0 if the file couldn't be opened, return 1 if everything
went well, or die if a syntax error is found.

=head1 SYNTAX TYPES

Syntax types mostly only refer to the +TRIGGER command, as that's the part of your code that's
put through a regexp.

=head2 strict

This is the default (and most recommended) syntax type. The rules are as follows:

  - Triggers must be lowercase, numbers and letters only.
  - Spaces are allowed. All other symbols are NOT allowed.

=head2 loose

This one is less strict on your trigger syntax. The recommended rules are as follows:

  - Triggers can be capitilized, lowercase, or any combination.
  - Triggers can contain letters or numbers or spaces.
  - Any foreign symbols aren't recommended, however it won't kill you.

The loose syntax check will only 'warn' when one of these isn't true, but it won't
hold it against you.

=head1 ALPHA SYNTAX

Here is the proper syntax of each Alpha command.

=head2 +TRIGGER

See SYNTAX TYPES.

=head2 -RESPONSE

A value of any length must be given. A response of all spaces is bad.

=head2 >LABEL

Two arguments must be given, separated by spaces: the label type, and its
one-word value.

=head2 <LABEL

One argument given.

=head2 @REDIRECT

Follows the same rules as +TRIGGER

=head2 &HOLDER

Follows the same rules as -RESPONSE

=head2 *CONDITION

Must follow this syntax exactly:

  * if ___ = ___::___
       ^var  ^val ^response

=head2 #CODE

Must have a length to it.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

No bugs known at the moment.

=head1 CHANGES

  Version 0.1
  - Initial release.

=head1 FUTURE PLANS

  - Add methods for defining your own syntax, for example if you make
    a custom mod to Chatbot::Alpha to add new commands, the syntax
    checker would know what to do with them.
