Revision history for Perl extension Chatbot::Alpha.

2.00  Thu Oct  6 18:53:00 2005
	- Added some AIML emulation:
		- In-reply redirections (like <srai>):
			+ * or something
			- Or something. {@<star1>}
	- "That" kind of support.
		+ i hate you
		- You're really mean... =(

		+ sorry
		% youre really mean
		- Don't worry--it's okay. :-)
	- Renamed all methods to be alternatingCaps instead of with underscores.
	- Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax supports the newly-added commands.
	- Fixed conditionals, should work more efficiently now:
		- Format changed to *VARIABLE=VALUE::HAPPENS
		- Does numeric == for numbers, or eq for strings... = better matching.

1.71  Sat Oct  1 14:01:00 2005
	- Sorting method reprogrammed for more efficient sorting.

        - Chatbot::Alpha::Syntax added.
        - ^ command added.
        - Module keeps filenames and line numbers internally, so on internal
                errors such as 'Deep Recursion' and 'Infinite Loop' it can point you
                to the source of the problem.
        - $alpha->search() method added.

1.40  Wed May  4 14:54:00 2005
